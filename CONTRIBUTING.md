# Contributing to KV-Store

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KV-Store!

We welcome contributions of all kinds—whether you're fixing bugs, improving performance, writing docs, or building new features. This guide will help you get started.

## How Can You Contribute?

### Improve Write RPS

Help us push the limits of write throughput:

- **Optimize the write path** – Identify bottlenecks in the Raft log replication or WAL writes
- **Reduce contention** – Improve batching strategies and minimize lock contention
- **Profile and tune hot paths** – Use Go's `pprof` to find and optimize performance-critical code

If you have experience with high-performance Go systems, this is a great area to dive into.

### Chaos and Failure Testing

Build confidence in our system's resilience:

- **Write chaos test scripts** – Automate failure injection scenarios
- **Simulate failures** – Node crashes, network partitions, disk failures
- **Validate correctness** – Ensure data consistency under adverse conditions

Check out `tests/chaos/` for existing test patterns.

---

### Documentation

Make the project more accessible:

- **Improve existing docs** – Fix typos, clarify explanations, add examples
- **Document architecture** – Explain design decisions, trade-offs, and system internals
- **Onboarding guides** – Help new contributors get up to speed quickly

**Note:** Documentation-only changes can be submitted directly as PRs without opening an issue first.

---

### CLI Development

Build a command-line interface for the KV store:

- **Preferred library:** [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- **Core commands:**
  - `get <key>` – Retrieve a value
  - `set <key> <value>` – Store a key-value pair
  - `delete <key>` – Remove a key
  - `cluster status` – View cluster health and node info

A well-designed CLI will make the project much more user-friendly.
